Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

	The Gaming Room was a client that wished to build a web-based game with the goal to reach multiple platforms. The client already had an Android for their game and was not sure how to set up the environment so they reached out to us to recommend and prototype a multi-platform solution.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

	I did an excellent job considering the client's needs and specifications when reasearching and recommending a solution. Each option needed to be weighed for things like security, cost, efficiency, and support.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

	Working through a design document allows and almost forces you to be organized in the planning phase of the software development lifecycle. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

	When I evaluated the pros and cons of different operating systems for the server, client and development enviornment, I wrote in paragraphs rather than bullet points. Using points would make the section more consice and readable.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

	It was very useful to break down the design into manageable pieces. Starting with the design constraints and digging deeper until I was breaking down each operating system's pros and cons as a server and client.
